        <p>TWICE completed their Singapore concert tonight following JYP Entertainment's official announcement that one member of the group, Mina, will be pulled out from the rest of their World Tour due to health concerns. 

The performances carried on as usual but Mina's parts were not taken over by any member and live feeds on the screen still included a photo of her.</p>
